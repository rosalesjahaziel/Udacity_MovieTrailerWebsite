# Udacity_MovieTrailerWebsite
Final project for intro to python udacity course. Created a movie trailers web site using python 2.7

#Execution
To create the web site we need the *fresh_tomatoes* file ([github link]).
##Create an instance
We need to import the library *fresh tomatoes*, and send a list of movies with the function open_movies_page()

```python
import fresh_tomatoes

instance_name.open_movies_page(list)
```

##Creating the HTML file
To create the html file we need to use the command:

```python
python entertainment_center.py
```
Whis will open automatically the website, otherwise you allways can open it in the folder where is the *fresh tomatoes* file
